									<h3 class="major">How It Started</h3>
									<p>My interest in IT was initially sparked by my father. My Dad was always interested in new pieces of technology and I grew up surrounded by new and exciting things I had never seen before. I was first exposed to touch screen technology because of the PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) that Dad used for work. I wasn’t really allowed to use it unless specifically allowed to. It could only be operated if you used the attached stylus and the screen was constructed with a film material that had a little give to it. A far cry from the scratch resistant Gorilla® Glass that is the industry standard now.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\motorola-rokr-e8-combo.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dad went on to buy an iPhone 3G when it was released and I couldn’t care less. My eyes were set on the Motorola Rokr E8 (Fig. 1) which became the first piece of technology that was all mine. I remember thinking it was so cool because it was a phone with a built in mp3 player. It’s selling point was a 3.5mm jack. It had no physical buttons and had a fully haptic touchpad that changed depending on what the phone was doing. My parents were generous as long as I put my head down, studied and got good grades. As a result, I got my first prebuilt desktop in year 8. It housed an Intel Core 2 Duo and a whopping 2 gigabytes of ram.  I remember borrowing Assassins Creed from a friend at school to install it on my computer. It had two disks in the box and took half a day to copy and install. With all the graphical settings on max it ran at around 15fps and I was thinking ‘Damn, this is living!’. This was probably around when my passion for gaming started to develop. </p>

									<p>I got my first laptop when I was in year 11. At this stage I was fairly tech literate and having my own laptop meant I had the opportunity to incorporate my studies with the power of computers on a whole new level. The laptop was meant for school work but it was predominantly used to play Halo 1 multiplayer on the school network with my classmates. The accessibility afforded by the laptop meant I was able to dabble in Photoshop and other graphic design applications to embellish my schoolwork. However I soon discovered that technology moves at a rapid pace and my laptop although sounding like a jet engine when in use, was in fact being left in the dust. The thirst for computing power had begun.</p>

									<p>Thus when I left home for university and was living in a college I decided what I really needed to experience everything on offer was a desktop computer. And I decided to build my own because pre-built computers were the devils work, as was the consensus on the internet it seemed. I went in headfirst with absolutely no idea what I was doing except for a How-To video on YouTube. My parents were happy that I managed to get into the MBBS program so they decided to sponsor it and thus no expense was spared. Ordered parts from three different computer stores and my friend helped me pick it all up. One weekend later it was done.  It worked splendidly. In fact that exact PC still works to this day, 9 years later. My time spent researching parts and learning about how it all goes together was my first foray into the production side of technology. I was very much a consumer when it came to technology and the internet. I had no desire at the time to go further as my biggest passion in relation to IT was gaming.</p>

									<p>My brief jaunt into the tech world through the experience of building my own computer had ignited a fire. A fire that at the time I had no money or time to fuel. I stoked it though. I watched videos by MKBHD and LinusTechTips on YouTube to curb my curiosity. I kept up with most gaming related news as that was (and is) a big part of my life. But the opportunity never presented itself for me to be able to consider pursuing IT more seriously.</p>

									<p>Technology still had my attention and as time went on it really did become information technology to me. The internet was a gateway to information, the largest library in the world populated with data simply through our use of the many apps and services available to us, and not always utilized for our benefit. I want to see this change. The scope of apps and services has expanded exponentially since they came into existence and I hope to be able to contribute to its further expansion. Especially in relation to the medical and IT field working hand in hand. Surgical simulation through VR, remote real time diagnosis through video or medical imaging, implantable detection devices and many more. These are possibilities that I wish to be able to pursue and hope to do so in the future. I still have very minimal experience in IT when it comes to production and I hope to be able to change that through my studies at RMIT.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Why Choose RMIT?</h3>
									<p>I chose RMIT for several reasons. Through my brief research before enrolment I learned that RMIT is well regarded in the IT sphere worldwide. The facilities and courses available cater to a wide range of studies within the IT field and the resources at our disposable are second to none. The location was also a big factor to me as I live close to Melbourne City and the campus being located within the city was also convenient. RMIT also offers students the ability to work on projects before graduation through student placements and industry partnerships. I believe this prepares students for real world scenarios and helps integrate them into the workplace. As a result RMIT has excellent job prospects for recent graduates having been ranked #4 for graduate employment (RMIT 2020) and this is important to me as I would like to be out and working as soon as my studies have been completed. Furthermore RMIT was ranked #3 in the global THE Impact Rankings (THE 2021), this indicates that RMIT University values inclusion, sustainability, equality and innovation among other things and these are all qualities that align with my personal views. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Learning Expectations</h3>
									<p>During my studies I expect to learn more about technology from the technical aspect. I have mainly interacted with technology as a consumer, and I wish to explore the more intricate production side of tech, apps and services. What makes advancements in tech possible? How are solutions designed? What new pieces of technology is feasible in the near future and what is still out of reach at this stage? These are all questions I hope to be able to answer or have a better understanding of through my studies at RMIT. </p>
