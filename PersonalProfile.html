									<h3 class="major">What Do The Results Mean to Me?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\Myers-Briggs Test.png" alt="" /></span>The Myers-Briggs test (Fig. 3) indicated that I am an Assertive Advocate and have a deep sense of idealism and integrity. Personally I value qualities such as honesty and work ethic and I can tend to be quite idealistic when it comes either my work or the people I choose to spend my time with. I strive for perfection and as a result I spend a lot of time and effort on my work and value quality over quantity. However this also means that I am always looking to do better rather just what is required. It also mentioned that advocates are the rarest personality type of all, and I believe this could also infer that I bring something unique or rare to the table.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\Learning Stylec rop.png" alt="" /></span>My Learning Style test results (Fig. 4) indicated that I am primarily a visual learner, with both auditory and kinesthetic a close second. This means that I obtain the most information when it can be absorbed via sight. Be it textbooks, diagrams, videos, etc. These would be my preferred mediums of learning tools. Personally I also feel that I am a fairly kinesthetic learner as well. I understand a lot through hands on learning experiences. Whether this be following tutorials or examples I do find I am able to understand the topic much easier through attempting it and through further practice. Much like sports.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\Big Five Personality.png" alt="" /></span>My Big Five Personality (Fig. 5) test results indicated high scores in emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness. This indicates that I am calm and measured, unlikely to instigate conflict and someone who values organization and diligence. I had a median score in intellect/imagination and a low score in extroversion. The low score in extroversion is consistent with my results from the Myers-Briggs test. My score in intellect/imagination indicates that I am a more conventional thinker rather than an imaginative one. I might struggle with abstract ideas or approaches often preferring the tried and tested method to get things done. The low score in extroversion indicates that I am unlikely to be social and outgoing. I would prefer to keep to myself and work in my own space.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How Will This Influence My Behaviour In A Team?</h3>
									<p>I believe I am likely to be a quiet member of the team. I am an organized and diligent worker who likes a workplace where there is a schedule and clear outline of the tasks that need to be performed. I am mindful of the people around me and would like to see them succeed as much as I would like to succeed myself. I believe this is a great quality in a team environment where the success of the group outweighs the success of the individual. I am unlikely to let people face unnecessary hardships and will bring such matters to light however I am unlikely to create conflict unless I see a great wrong being done. I am empathetic and sensitive and thus an integral part of a group dynamic. But as I hold myself to such a high regard, I might also be quite sensitive to constructive criticism and might not always take it well. I will absorb information best through visual aids rather than audio. I will also get better at tasks the more I do them. I am likely to be a calm presence in a team dynamic. A voice of reason. </p>

									<h3 class="major">How Should I Take This Into Account When Forming A Team?</h3>
									<p>A clear vision and schedule is of utmost importance to me. I should look to obtain input from others when it comes to abstract or unconventional ideas. I should be open and accountable for my actions and be willing to face criticism with an open mind. I should be mindful of forming teams where everyone is on the same page. No one should be concerned about individual success and should instead be looking to succeed together. A fair and equal system should also be in place where no one has to work harder than another. We should be open and honest with our troubles and difficulties but also share our successes with each other.</p>

									<p>It is often most of these test results only focus on the more positive indicators rather than the negative ones associated with the results. As a result it is hard to paint a proper picture of a person based on these test results alone. Everyone is individual and everyone is unique in their own right. The positives and negatives are but guidelines that one can expect to draw from rather than ones to base their life on. I like to think I have leadership qualities but if I was to follow the test results I would be one to shirk leadership and I believe that is inaccurate. Even though I am organized I often struggle with meeting deadlines and procrastinate. Even though I am predominantly an introvert I am not afraid of drawing attention to myself. These are all instances of irregularities when compared to my test results. The test results are not a be all and end all of every individual and I believe we should choose to tread our own path to success. </p>
