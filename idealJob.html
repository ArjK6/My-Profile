									<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>Here is an abstract from a job advertisement that I hope to one day be able to fill.</p>

										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images\Job Ad.png" alt="" /></span></div>

										<h3 class="major">Why Is This Position Appealing?</h3>
										<p>I find this position appealing as it melds my interests in software development as well as my passion for both the medical and IT field together. The advertised role is to primarily improve the software app they utilize in the diagnosis of epilepsy. This involves writing and testing code utilising Typescript with React Native. Furthermore the role encompasses cloud and hardware development as well as collaborating with teammates to ensure the deliverables are being met and contributing new ideas in discussions to promote innovation. </p>

										<p> I strongly believe that new and innovative ways to deliver health care or health related services through IT will be an opportunity I will greatly relish. The advertiser Seer Medical listed their objectives and I believe they align with my personal goals as well. I want to see a more streamlined and higher quality of healthcare delivery through the use of technology. In doing so I want to achieve a net positive outcome when it comes to both patients, caregivers and the larger health system. I want to design and develop new and innovative avenues to achieves the directives listed previous. Furthermore being able to directly witness your impact on the wellbeing of other people is something I will always cherish.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Skills and Qualifications Required?</h3>
										<p>Reading the brief description, I would estimate most viable candidates would have a minimum of 3 years experience in various software development roles if not more. This would include experience in both front and back end development. Front end development encompasses more visual components as it deals with the client interface. Thus it often entails experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as an eye for design and visual aesthetics. Backend development deals more with writing code, developing APIâ€™s for seamless communication between the app and the database as well as database and security management. They often work with Java, PHP and Python (SwitchUp, 2020). Programming languages particular to this role would be Typescript. Cloud development requires knowledge of Azure or AWS in most cases. Additionally it mentions experience with embedded or Linux systems and Git or CI/CD are looked up favourably. Furthermore a viable candidate would possess the fundamentals of any role being communication, organization, work ethic and presentation. This in turn with the ability to work in a diverse team to tackle modern problems would make for the ideal candidate for this role.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Skills and Qualifications Possessed?</h3>
										<p>I currently possess very little of the skills required to be able to fulfil this role. Through my brief studies at RMIT I have been exposed to both HTML/CSS as well as Python so far. I have also begun to utilize GitHub to host repositories. As of yet my understanding is that of a very basic level but I hope to build upon this during my studies at RMIT University. Additionally I believe I am an organized, hard working individual who values communication and presentation. I also believe that I am able to work well in a team environment thus I possess the fundamental skills most jobs require. </p>

										<h3 class="major">Learning Plan</h3>
										<p>I plan to obtain a higher understanding of HTML/CSS, GitHub and Python during my studies at RMIT. Undertaking various group and individual projects for assessment will also help me build upon my teamwork and project management skills as well. I will be looking to undertake a range of IT options such as Cloud Foundations, Systems Deployment and Operations and Scripting Language Programming later on in my studies that will create a solid foundation for me to build upon as I undertake junior development roles after graduation. I will look to obtain a certificate in Azure or AWS to gain a better understanding of cloud infrastructure and also gain some experience working with React and other mobile development platforms. </p>
